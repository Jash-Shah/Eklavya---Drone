## _Our Journey in Building a Drone and its Control System_

Strange title isn't it? It manages to sum up our experience with this project quite well though. For the Eklavya Mentorship program, my teammate and I had the task of building a drone from scratch and designing it's control system.

Quite an intimidating task for the both of us, given that we were complete beginners in almost all areas of robotics. Thankfully we had the guidance of some great mentors and an amazing community thanks to our college club: [SRA](https://sravjti.in/).

> Q: So how does one build a drone?

> A: You design it first
