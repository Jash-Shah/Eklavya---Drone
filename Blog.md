# Pain and PIDs: Our Journey in Drone Design

## Introduction

Strange title isn't it? It manages to sum up our experience with this project quite well though. For the Eklavya Mentorship program, my teammate and I had the task of building a drone from scratch and designing it's control system.

Quite an intimidating task for the both of us, given that we were complete beginners in almost all areas of robotics. Thankfully we had the guidance of some great mentors and an amazing community thanks to our college club: [SRA](https://sravjti.in/).

> Q: So how does one go about building a drone?

> A: You design it first

We started out at the same place everyone does when they need to do something but don't know how to: **YouTube**

Incidentally we went for the **fourth video** in this list, mainly because it looked cool

After a lot of hours in Solidworks, our finished model was ready.
