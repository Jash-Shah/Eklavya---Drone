<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Drone aviation is an emerging industry. With possibilities for its applications in agriculture, healthcare, e-commerce as well as traffic control. We wanted to get first hand experience with how a drone is designed as well as how it flies to get a firm grasp on the principles needed to work with drones in the future

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and installlation
* Tested on [Ubuntu 20.04])(https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)
* [Gazebo Sim](http://gazebosim.org/)
Do visit these websites for the installation steps of the above mentioned software. 
It is recommended to install Gazebo along with ROS and not seperately

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jash-Shah/Eklavya---Drone.git
```
Add this folder in the src directory of your catkin workspace
Create the src folder if it doesn't already exist by
```sh
mkdir src
```
Initialise the project with
```sh
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

### Execution
Open two terminal windows and run the following commands
- Terminal 1
```sh
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch drone vitarana_drone drone.launch
```
- Terminal 2
```sh
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun vitarana_drone control.py
```

*Insert image of how it looks like executed here
Or a gif of you typing said commands*


<!-- RESULTS AND DEMO -->
## Results and Demo
*Add the videos, gifs and other things here*

<!-- FUTURE WORK -->
## Future Work
- [x] Create a control system for the drone using PID
- [x] Stabilise the Roll, Pitch and Yaw of the Drone 
- [x] Get the drone to fly at any arbitrary altitude
- [] Have the drone fly to given co-ordinates and stabilise itself
